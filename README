# Astah-Class-Diagram-and-Java-equivalent



This project consists in a Class Diagram created in Astah Professional. 
The main theme was a system for students in order to chose an optional subject at the faculty. 
There are 3 algorithms for distributing the students at their options: "PreferinteDupaMedii, PreferinteInFunctieDeRestante, OSinguraOptiuneDupaMedieApoiRandom". 
The entire class diagram was then represented in java as classes, and all their bonds as inheritance, aggregation. 
There were mainly used POO concepts and some Java structures.
